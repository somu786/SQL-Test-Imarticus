# que num 7: What are Entities and Relationships?

# Entities : An entity is a real-world object. 
# A university database can have entities such as Student, Lecturer, Course, Project, etc. In a DBMS, these entities are the tables.
# The attributes describe the entities. The student entity can have attributes such as id and name. 
# The course entity can have attributes such as course_code and course_name. The Lecturer can have attributes such as id, name and speciality.

# Relationships : A relationship signifies an association among the entities. There are three types of relationships that can exist between the entities. They are the binary, recursive and the ternary relationship.
# When one instance of an entity is associated with one instance of another type of entity, it is called one to one (1:1) relationship
# When one instance of an entity is associated with many instances of another type of entity, it is called one to many (1: m) relationship.
# When many instances of an entity are associated with many instances of another type of entity, it is called many to many (m : n) relationship.
# when an entity is related to itself, it is called a recursive relationship.
